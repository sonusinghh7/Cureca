# Currency Exchange Rate calculator

## This project may help you to convert the currency of one type (let's say 'â‚¹', Rupee) to another type (like '$', USD)

This is my first full stack project, building up an currecy exchange calculator to convert from one type to another type of currency.

* in this project we will be using Express.Js for Backend
* we shall be using Vite for Frontend, and Axios to fetch APIs
* using [Exchange Rate APi](https://exchangeratesapi.io/)
it's free, but it does requires sign up
